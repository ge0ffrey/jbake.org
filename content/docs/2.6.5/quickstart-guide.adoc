== Setup

First link:/download.html[download JBake] and follow the <<installation>> instructions. After that open a command prompt and run the following command to make 
sure everything is working:

----
jbake -h
----

You should then see the following output:

----

Usage: jbake ...

== Create a Project

To get up and running quickly with JBake you can use it's example project structure along with sample templates as a starting point for you project or site. To do so 
first you will need to create a new directory and change into it:

----
$ mkdir project
$ cd project
----

Then you can use JBake to initialise this directory with it's example project structure and templates by executing the following command:

----
$ jbake -i
----

NOTE: This will use http://freemarker.org[Freemarker] templates by default, see the <<usage>> section on how to specify the template engine you prefer.

== Bake

Once you have added some real content to your project and customised your templates you can bake your project by executing the following commands:

----
$ cd project
$ jbake -b
----

NOTE: This will place the baked project into a directory called `output` in the current directory by default.

== Preview

You can then see what your baked project looks like immediately by running JBake in server mode:

----
$ cd project
$ jbake -s

JBake v2.6.4 (2018-10-16 17:56) [http://jbake.org]

Serving out contents of: [output] on http://localhost:8820/
(To stop server hit CTRL-C)
----

You can then preview it in your browser at http://localhost:8820.

That's all there is to it, you can go from nothing to a fully baked site in minutes.

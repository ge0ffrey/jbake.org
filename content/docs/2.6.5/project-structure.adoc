Here is an example source directory structure for a project:

----
.
|-- assets
|   |-- favicon.gif
|   |-- robots.txt
|   |-- img
|   |   |-- logo.png
|   |-- js
|   |   |-- custom.js
|   |-- css
|       |-- style.css
|
|-- content
|   |-- about.html
|   |-- 2013
|       |-- 01
|       |   |-- hello-world.html
|       |-- 02
|           |-- weekly-links-1.ad
|           |-- weekly-links-2.md
|
|-- templates
|   |-- index.ftl
|   |-- page.ftl
|   |-- post.ftl
|   |-- feed.ftl
|
|-- jbake.properties
----

== Assets Directory

The assets directory is where you should place your static files such as images, CSS files and JavaScript files etc. These files are copied over to the
baked output as is. You can create any directory structure you like in the assets directory and this structure will be maintained when copied.

== Content Directory

The content directory is where your content files should be placed, these files will be "mixed" with the templates to generate the baked output. Again
you can create any directory structure you like for your content, this structure will be maintained when the baked output is created.

The extension of the content file determines what type of content it contains:

* `.html` = raw HTML content
* `.md` = http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax[Markdown] formatted content
* `.ad` = http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[AsciiDoc] formatted content
* `.adoc` = http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[AsciiDoc] formatted content
* `.asciidoc` = http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[AsciiDoc] formatted content

NOTE: JBake uses https://github.com/vsch/flexmark-java[flexmark-java] to support Markdown format and http://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor] to support AsciiDoc format.

=== Static files in Content

Any files other than above listed content files, will be treated as static files. When site is baked, all these files will be copied as-is to output folder, while maintaining their directory structure.
For example, /content/blog/2013/images/abc.jpg will be copied to to /output/blog/2013/images/abc.jpg.

== Templates Directory

The templates directory is where your templates files go, these files are "mixed" with your content files to generate the baked output. You should place your
templates into the root of this directory.

The extension of the template file determines the template engine:

* `.ftl` = http://freemarker.org[Freemarker]
* `.gsp` = http://www.groovy-lang.org/[Groovy's SimpleTemplateEngine]
* `.groovy` = http://www.groovy-lang.org/[Groovy's SimpleTemplateEngine]
* `.gxml` = http://www.groovy-lang.org/[Groovy's XmlTemplateEngine]
* `.tpl` = http://www.groovy-lang.org/[Groovy's MarkupTemplateEngine]
* `.thyme` = http://www.thymeleaf.org/[Thymeleaf]
* `.html` = http://www.thymeleaf.org/[Thymeleaf]
* `.jade` = https://github.com/neuland/jade4j[Jade]


It is recommended that you don't mix different template types, try to stick to just 1 type of templates in your project.

For more information on what you can do in each template engine have a look at the example templates provided with JBake and their
respective documentation: http://freemarker.org/docs/index.html[Freemarker], http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/documentation/template-engines.html[Groovy],
http://www.thymeleaf.org/doc/html/Using-Thymeleaf.html[Thymeleaf] & https://github.com/neuland/jade4j[Jade].

== Ignoring Files and Directories
It is possible to ignore certain folders or files in content and assets dirctory to be ignored by JBake.

=== Ignore Directories
If you add a file named `.jbakeignore` in a folder then JBake will ignore contents of that folder and all of its sub-folders.

- If ignored folder is in content, then none of the source files will be rendered/copied by JBake.
- If ignored folder is in assets, then resources in that folder will not be copied to baked site.

WARNING: If you are referring resources from ignored folder in non-ignored source content, then that might result in broken links.

=== Ignore files
All hidden files from content directory are ignored by JBake.

== Project Configuration

Your project specific configuration is held within the `jbake.properties` file which should be located in the root directory of the project. This file controls
how your project is baked. See <<configuration>> section for more details.

== Altering Default Structure

You can also alter the default structure by setting some specific configuration options in your `jbake.properties` file. So you could have the following structure:

----
.
|-- site
|   |-- assets
|   |   |-- favicon.gif
|   |   |-- robots.txt
|   |   |-- img
|   |   |   |-- logo.png
|   |   |-- js
|   |   |   |-- custom.js
|   |   |-- css
|   |       |-- style.css
|   |-- content
|   |   |-- about.html
|   |   |-- 2013
|   |       |-- 01
|   |       |   |-- hello-world.html
|   |       |-- 02
|   |           |-- weekly-links-1.ad
|   |           |-- weekly-links-2.md
|   |-- templates
|       |-- index.ftl
|       |-- page.ftl
|       |-- post.ftl
|       |-- feed.ftl
|
|-- jbake.properties
----

By defining the following configuration options:

----
...
asset.folder=site/assets
content.folder=site/content
template.folder=site/templates
...
----

You can also use absolute path references for each option too as well as relative path references.

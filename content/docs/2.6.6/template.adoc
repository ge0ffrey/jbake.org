== Default Templates

There are default template files defined in JBake that are used to render a number of special pages that require no content files to be present, these are:

* `index` - used to render an index.html file
* `archive` - used to render an archive.html file
* `feed` - used to render a feed.xml file
* `tag` - used to render a HTML file for each tag used
* `sitemap` - used to render a sitemap.xml file

If you don't require any of these special pages to be rendered then you can turn off the rendering of them by adding the following lines to your 
`jbake.properties` file:

----
...
render.index=false
render.archive=false
render.feed=false
render.tags=false
render.sitemap=false
...
----

There are also two default templates files defined in JBake that are used to render content files, these are:

* `page` - used to render any content file marked with a type of 'page'
* `post` - used to render any content file marked with a type of 'post'

== Custom Templates

You also have the ability to define new custom templates that can be used when rendering different types of content files.

First add the following line to your `jbake.properties` file:

----
...
template.<customtype>.file=templateXYZ.ftl
...
----

NOTE: You are limited to the following characters to define your `<customtype>`: [A-Za-z0-9-_]

Then create your template file and place it into the 'templates' folder inside your project, after that you can create your content files making sure 
that the metadata header has the following entry:

----
...
type=<customtype>
...
----

If you'd like the content files to be rendered with your custom template file using a different extension then add the following to your `jbake.properties` file:

----
...
template.<customtype>.extension=.xml
...
----

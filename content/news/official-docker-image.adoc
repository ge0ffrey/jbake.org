== Official Docker Image Released

Along with the recent link:/news/jbake-v2-6-7-released.html[JBake v2.6.7] release I'm happy to announce that an official https://hub.docker.com/r/jbake/jbake[Docker image] is now available for JBake.
Allowing you to execute JBake without needing to install JBake on your local system.

Details on how to use the Docker image are available on the link:/download.html[download] page.

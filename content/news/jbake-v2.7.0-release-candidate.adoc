== JBake v2.7.0 release candidate available

We're getting close to the release of JBake v2.7.0, and given the scale of code changes that have been made recently we thought it was prudent to make a release candidate available.

So JBake v2.7.0-rc.2 is now available from https://github.com/jbake-org/jbake/releases[GitHub Releases]

We'd be really grateful if you could try this release candidate out against any JBake sites/projects you have. If you encounter any issues please https://github.com/jbake-org/jbake/issues[let us know] so we can address them prior to the final release of v2.7.0
